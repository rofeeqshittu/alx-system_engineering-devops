# 0x0E. Web Stack Debugging #1

## Project Overview
This project is focused on debugging an Nginx installation to make it listen on port 80 of all the serverâ€™s active IPv4 IPs. By writing minimal Bash scripts, you'll ensure the server is configured correctly and running as expected.

| [`0-nginx_likes_port_80`](./0-nginx_likes_port_80)                        | Bash script that configures Nginx to listen on port 80 of all active IPv4 IPs on the server.          |
| [`1-debugging_made_short`](./1-debugging_made_short)                      | A shorter, more concise Bash script to ensure Nginx is properly configured to listen on port 80.      |

## What the Project Will Do
- Debug Nginx installation to ensure it's running and listening on port 80.
- Automate the configuration process with minimal commands in a Bash script.

## Usage
- Run the script `0-nginx_likes_port_80` to configure the server.
- Verify that Nginx is properly listening on port 80 by using `curl 0:80`.
